A linked list is a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming to organize and store data in a linear manner. 
Unlike arrays, which use contiguous blocks of memory to store elements, a linked list consists of individual nodes, each containing both data and a reference or pointer to the next node.
This linkage between nodes forms a chain-like structure, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and easy insertion or removal of elements. 
The first node of a linked list is called the "head", and the last node typically points to a null value, indicating the end of the list or "tail" of the list. 
Linked lists can be singly linked, where each node points to the next one, or doubly linked, where each node points both to the next and the previous node, offering bidirectional traversal. 
The flexibility and efficient memory management make linked lists suitable for various applications, including implementing stacks, queues, and certain search algorithms. 
However, accessing elements in a linked list has linear time complexity, and random access is not as efficient as arrays due to the lack of direct index-based access.
